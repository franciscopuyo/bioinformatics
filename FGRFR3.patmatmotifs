# * EGF-like domain signatures and profile *
# ******************************************
# 
# A sequence of  about thirty  to forty amino-acid  residues  long found in  the
# sequence of  epidermal  growth  factor  (EGF)  has been  shown  [1 to 6] to be
# present, in  a more or less conserved form, in a large number of other, mostly
# animal  proteins.  EGF  is  a  polypeptide  of about 50 amino acids with three
# internal  disulfide  bridges.  It  first  binds with high affinity to specific
# cell-surface receptors and then induces their dimerization, which is essential
# for  activating  the  tyrosine  kinase  in  the  receptor  cytoplasmic domain,
# initiating  a  signal  transduction  that  results  in  DNA synthesis and cell
# proliferation.
# 
# A  common  feature  of  all  EGF-like  domains  is  that they are found in the
# extracellular  domain  of  membrane-bound  proteins or in proteins known to be
# secreted (exception: prostaglandin G/H synthase). The EGF-like domain includes
# six cysteine residues which have been shown to be involved in disulfide bonds.
# The  structure  of several EGF-like domains has been solved. The fold consists
# of   two-stranded  beta-sheet  followed  by  a  loop  to  a  C-terminal  short
# two-stranded sheet   (see   <PDB:1EGF>).   Subdomains  between  the  conserved
# cysteines strongly  vary  in  length  as  shown  in  the  following  schematic
# representation of the EGF-like domain:

# 
# Two different  types  of thiolase [1,2,3] are found  both in eukaryotes and in
# prokaryotes: acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (EC 2.3.1.9) and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase
# (EC 2.3.1.16).  3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (also called thiolase I)  has  a broad
# chain-length specificity  for  its substrates and is involved   in degradative
# pathways  such as  fatty acid  beta-oxidation.  Acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (also
# called thiolase  II)  is  specific  for  the  thiolysis of acetoacetyl-CoA and
# involved in biosynthetic pathways such  as poly beta-hydroxybutyrate synthesis
# or steroid biogenesis.
# 
# In eukaryotes, there are two forms of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase: one  located in
# the mitochondrion and the other in peroxisomes.
# 
# There are two conserved cysteine residues important for thiolase activity. The
# first located  in  the  N-terminal  section  of the enzymes is involved in the
# formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate; the second located at the C-terminal
# extremity is   the   active   site  base  involved  in  deprotonation  in  the
# condensation reaction.
# 
# Mammalian nonspecific  lipid-transfer  protein (nsL-TP)  (also known as sterol
# carrier protein 2) is a protein which seems  to exist  in two different forms:
# a 14  Kd  protein  (SCP-2)  and  a larger 58 Kd protein (SCP-x). The former is
# found in the cytoplasm or the mitochondria and is involved in lipid transport;
# the latter is found in peroxisomes.  The C-terminal part of SCP-x is identical
# to SCP-2  while  the  N-terminal  portion is evolutionary related to thiolases
# [4].
# 
# We developed  three  signature  patterns  for  this family of proteins, two of
# which are  based  on  the regions around the biologically important cysteines.
# The third  is  based  on  a  highly conserved region in the C-terminal part of
# these proteins.

# Ferredoxins  are small, acidic, electron transfer proteins that are ubiquitous

# 
# Ferredoxins  [1]  are a group  of  iron-sulfur proteins which mediate electron
# transfer in  a  wide variety  of   metabolic  reactions.   Ferredoxins  can be
# divided into several subgroups  depending upon the physiological nature of the
# iron-sulfur  cluster(s).   One of these  subgroups are the 4Fe-4S ferredoxins,
# which  are  found  in   bacteria  and  which   are thus  often    referred  as
# 'bacterial-type' ferredoxins.  The structure of these proteins [2] consists of
# the duplication of a  domain of twenty six amino  acid residues; each of these
# domains contains four cysteine residues that bind to a 4Fe-4S center.
# 
# Several  structures  of the 4Fe-4S ferredoxin domain have been determined (see
# for  example <PDB:1FDN>) [3]. The clusters consist of two interleaved 4Fe- and
# 4S-tetrahedra  forming  a  cubane-like  structure, in such a way that the four
# iron  occupy the eight corners of a distorted cube. Each 4Fe-4S is attached to
# the polypeptide chain by four covalent Fe-S bonds involving cysteine residues.
# 
# A number  of  proteins  have  been found [4]  that  include one or more 4Fe-4S
# binding domains similar to those of bacterial-type ferredoxins. These proteins
# are  listed  below:
# 
#  - The iron-sulfur proteins  of  the succinate  dehydrogenase and the fumarate
#    reductase  complexes (EC 1.3.99.1).  These  enzyme   complexes,  which  are
#    components of the tricarboxylic  acid cycle, each contain three subunits: a
#    flavoprotein,  an iron-sulfur protein,  and a b-type cytochrome.  The iron-
#    sulfur proteins contain three  different  iron-sulfur  centers: a 2Fe-2S, a
#    3Fe-4S  and a 4Fe-4S.
#  - Escherichia coli anaerobic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.5)
#    This enzyme is composed of three subunits: A, B, and C. The C subunit seems
#    to be an  iron-sulfur  protein  with  two ferredoxin-like domains in the N-
#    terminal part of the  protein.
#  - Escherichia coli anaerobic dimethyl sulfoxide reductase.  The  B subunit of
#    this  enzyme  (gene dmsB)  is  an  iron-sulfur  protein  with  four  4Fe-4S
#    ferredoxin-like domains.
#  - Escherichia coli  formate  hydrogenlyase.  Two   of  the  subunits  of this
#    oligomeric complex (genes hycB and hycF) seem  to  be  iron-sulfur proteins
#    that each contain two 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-like domains.
#  - Methanobacterium formicicum formate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.2). This enzyme
#    is used by the archaebacteria  to grow on formate.  The  beta chain of this
#    dimeric enzyme probably binds two 4Fe-4S centers.
#  - Escherichia  coli  formate  dehydrogenases  N  and O (EC 1.2.1.2). The beta
#    chain  of these two enzymes (genes fdnH and fdoH) are  iron-sulfur proteins
#    with four 4Fe-4S ferredoxin-like domains.
#  - Desulfovibrio periplasmic [Fe] hydrogenase (EC 1.18.99.1).  The large chain
#    of this dimeric enzyme binds three 4Fe-4S centers, two of which are located
#    in the ferredoxin-like N-terminal region of the protein.
#  - Methanobacterium  thermoautrophicum  methyl  viologen-reducing  hydrogenase
#    subunit mvhB, which contains six  tandemly repeated ferredoxin-like domains
#    and which probably binds twelve 4Fe-4S centers.
#  - Salmonella typhimurium anaerobic sulfite reductase (EC 1.8.1.-) [5]. Two of
#    the subunits of  this enzyme (genes asrA and asrC) seem  to  both  bind two
#    4Fe-4S centers.
#  - A Ferredoxin-like protein  (gene fixX)  from  the  nitrogen-fixation  genes
#    locus of various  Rhizobium  species,  and   one  from  the  Nif-region  of
#    Azotobacter species.
#  - The 9 Kd  polypeptide  of chloroplast photosystem I [6]  (gene psaC).  This
#    protein contains two low potential 4Fe-4S centers, referred as  the A and B
#    centers.
#  - The chloroplast frxB protein which is predicted to carry two 4Fe-4S centers.
#  - An ferredoxin  from a  primitive  eukaryote,  the enteric amoeba  Entamobea
#    histolytica.
#  - Escherichia  coli  hypothetical  protein  yjjW, a protein with a N-terminal
#    region belonging to the radical activating enzymes family (see <PDOC00834>)
#    and two potential 4Fe-4S centers.
# 
# The  pattern  of  cysteine residues in the iron-sulfur region is sufficient to
# detect  this class of 4Fe-4S binding proteins. The profile we developed covers
# the whole domain.

# 
# Integrins [1,2] are a large family of cell surface receptors that mediate cell
# to cell as well as cell to matrix adhesion. Some integrins recognize the R-G-D
# sequence in their extracellular matrix protein ligand. Structurally, integrins
# consist of a dimer of an alpha and a beta chain.  Each  subunit  has  a  large
# N-terminal extracellular domain followed by a transmembrane domain and a short
# C-terminal cytoplasmic  region. Some receptors share a common beta chain while
# having different  alpha chains.  The  sequence  of  a number of different beta
# chains has been determined and are listed below:
# 
#  - Integrin beta-1, which  associates with alpha-1 to form a laminin receptor,
#    with alpha-2 to form a  collagen receptor, with  alpha-4  to  interact with
#    VCAM-1, with alpha-5 to form a fibronectin receptor, and with alpha-8.
#  - Integrin beta-2, which  associates with alpha-L (LFA-1)  to  interact  with
#    ICAM-1, and with alpha-M (MAC-1) or alpha-X  (p150,95) to form the receptor
#    for the iC3b fragment of the third complement component.
#  - Integrin beta-3, which associates with alpha-IIB  to  form  a  receptor for
#    fibrinogen,  fibronectin,  vitronectin and VWF, and with alpha-V  to form a
#    vitronectin receptor.
#  - Integrin beta-4, which associates with alpha-6.
#  - Integrin beta-5, which associates with alpha-V.
#  - Integrin beta-6 [3].
#  - Integrin beta-7 [4].
#  - Integrin beta-8, which associates with alpha-V [5].
#  - The Drosophila myospheroid protein, a probable integrin beta chain.
# 
# All the integrin beta chains contain four repeats of a forty amino acid region
# in the C-terminal extremity of their extracellular domain. Each of the repeats
# contains eight  cysteines.   We have developed a pattern from a section of the
# repeated region that includes five of these conserved cysteines.

# therefore called  C-terminal  cystine-knot  (CTCK).  Members of the C-terminal
# cystine knot family are listed below:
# 
#  - von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multifunctional protein which is involved in
#    maintaining homeostasis.  It consists of 4 vWF type D domains, 3 vWF type A
#    domains, 3  vWF  type  B  domains, 2 vWF type C domains (see <PDOC00928>, a
#    X domain and the C-terminal cystine knot.
#  - Mucins.  Human  mucin  2, a highly polymorphic multidomain molecule with  a
#    modular architecture  similar  to  vWF.  Xenopus mucin B.1 which contains a
#    CCP domain, a vWF type C domain, a X domain and a CTCK. Other  mucins  that
#    contain a  CTCK  are  the  human tracheobronchial mucin (gene MUC5), bovine
#    submaxillary mucin-like protein, pig apomucin and rat intestinal mucin-like
#    protein.
#  - CCN  family  (cef-10/cyr61/CTFG/fisp-12/nov  protein family). These growth-
#    factor inducible   proteins  are  structurally  related to the insulin-like
#    growth factor binding proteins (see <PDOC00194>) and could also function as
#    growth-factor binding proteins.
#  - Drosophila slit protein which is essential for  development of midline glia
#    and commissural axon pathways. It is composed of four leucine-rich repeats,
#    seven EGF-like domains, a laminin G-like repeat and the CTCK.
#  - Norrie disease protein (NDP) which may be involved in neuroectodermal cell-
#    cell interaction   and   in   a   pathway   that   regulates   neural  cell
#    differentiation and proliferation.
#  - Silk  moth hemocytin, an humoral lectin which is involved in a self-defence
#    mechanism. It  is  composed  of 2 FA58C domains (see <PDOC00988>), a C-type
#    lectin domain  (see  <PDOC00537>),  2  VWFC domains (see <PDOC00928), and a
#    CTCK.
# 
# The pattern  we  developed  for  CTCK correspond to the C-terminal half of the
# domain.

# * VWFC domain signature and profile *
# *************************************
# 
# The VWFC  domain  is named after the von Willebrand factor (VWF) type C repeat
# which is  found  twice  in  this multidomain protein [1,2]. It has a length of
# about 70  amino acids covering 10 well conserved cysteines. Proteins with such
# a domain [1-4] are listed below.
# 
#  - Human  von Willebrand factor  (VWF),  a multifunctional protein involved in
#    maintaining homeostasis.  It consists of 4 VWFD domains,  3 VWFA domains, 3
#    VWFB domains, 3 VWFC domains, an X domain and a C-terminal cystine knot [2].
#  - Silk  moth hemocytin, an humoral lectin which is involved in a self-defence
#    mechanism. It  is  composed  of 2 FA58C domains (see <PDOC00988>), a C-type
#    lectin domain   (see   <PDOC00537>),  2  VWFC  domains,  and  a  CTCK  (see
#    <PDOC00912>).
#  - Several  vertebrate heavily glycosylated  mucins. Human mucin 2 is secreted
#    by the  epithelia  of  different  mucus membrane-containing organs. It is a
#    highly polymorphic  multidomain molecule. Rat intestinal mucin-like peptide
#    coats the  epithelia  of  the  intestines.  Both  proteins  share a modular
#    architecture similar  to  VWF. Xenopus mucin B.1 contains a Sushi domain, a
#    VWFC domain,  a  X  domain and a C-terminal cystine knot. Other mucins that
#    contain the  VWFC  domain  are  human tracheobronchial mucin (MUC5), bovine
#    submaxillary mucin-like protein, human and pig apomucin.
#  - Cef-10/cyr61/CTGF/fisp-12/nov  protein  family.  The members of this family
#    are structurally  related  to   insulin-like growth factor binding proteins
#    (see <PDOC00194>) and could  function  as  growth  factor-binding proteins.
#    They contain an insulin-like growth factor-binding domain, a VWFC repeat, a
#    thrombospondin type 1 repeat (Tsp1) and a C-terminal cystine knot.
#  - Vertebrate  thrombospondins  1  and 2. These adhesive glycoproteins mediate
#    cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions. They are composed of a common
#    thrombospondin N-terminal  domain  (TspN),  a VWFC domain, three Tsp type 1
#    repeats (Tsp1), 3 to 4 EGF-like domains and 7 calcium-binding Tsp3 repeats.
#  - Vertebrate propeptides of fibrillar collagens alpha 1(I, II & III) and 2(V)
#    chains that  contain  an  N-terminal  VWFC  domain, a collagenous region of
#    about 1000  amino  acids  and  a  C-terminus  common to fibrillar collagens
#    (COLFI domain).
#  - Vertebrate  integral  membrane  protein  DGCR2/IDD,  a  potential  adhesion
#    receptor with  1  LDL-receptor  class  A domain (see <PDOC00929>), a C-type
#    lectin and a VWFC domain.
#  - Chordin, a Xenopus developmental protein that contains four VWFC domains.
# 
# Of these proteins, the best characterized one is the von Willebrand factor for
# which the duplicated VWFC domain is thought to participate in oligomerization,
# but not in  the initial dimerization step [4].  The presence of this region in
# other  complex-forming  proteins leads to the assumption  that the VWFC domain
# might be involved in forming larger protein complexes [1,2].
# 
# The profile we developed covers the entire VWFC domain.
